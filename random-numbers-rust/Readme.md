LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) is a simple and fast algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers. It uses a linear recurrence relation with parameters like a multiplier, increment, and modulus. While LCG is widely used, it has limitations like periodicity and sensitivity to parameter selection. Various modifications have been proposed to enhance its performance. LCG is commonly employed in simulations, statistical sampling, and computer graphics.
