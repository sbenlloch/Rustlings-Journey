# Rustlings-Journey

Welcome to the Rustlings-Journey! This repository is a collection of small projects that I have used to practice Rust. It provides a hands-on experience for beginners like me to experiment with Rust and explore its key features.

## Projects

1. **Pseudorandom Number Generator:** A simple implementation of a pseudorandom number generator in Rust.

2. **Checksum CRC16 Maker:** An implementation of a checksum CRC16 maker in Rust, calculating cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksums using the CRC-16 algorithm.

3. **IEEE 754:** Little program to understand IEEE 754 standard.

4. **Grayscaling Image Converter:** converts an image file to grayscale

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different values, and enjoy learning Rust!
